I am an Assistant Professor in [Biomedical Informatics](https://med.emory.edu/departments/biomedical-informatics/index.html) at Emory University, where I direct the CARE Lab (Collective Action & Research for Equity). My research is on the design of data/AI-driven systems that target health equity for marginalized communities and care workers. I have a Ph.D. in human-centered computing and an undergraduate degree in computer engineering from Georgia Tech. I am also the co-founder of [MakerGhat](https://makerghat.org), an education nonprofit in India that aims to nurture the next generation of leaders and entrepreneurs from underserved communities. 

*I am building an interdisciplinary lab across Emory and Georgia Tech, and actively recruiting students and postdocs with an interest in HCI (human-computer interaction), computing or informatics, public health, and nursing.*

As an interdisciplinary scholar, I engage in ethnographic fieldwork, participatory design, system development, and evaluation. I frequently draw on feminist perspectives when analyzing AI efforts, and center communities that have been pushed to the margins on account of gender, race, class, religion, caste, rurality, and more. My research has entailed developing long-term relationships with communities, non-profit health organizations, and industry actors. I have previously worked with Google’s AI for Social Good Team, the Wadhwani Institute for AI, UN Global Pulse, and Philips Research North America. I have been fortunate to receive several honors for this work including the Google Award for Inclusion Research, the ACM SIGCHI Dissertation Award, and Forbes 30 under 30 Asia. I was also named to the list of 100 Brilliant Women in AI Ethics, and one of 75 women in STEAM by the Office of the Principal Scientific Advisor to the Government of India. 

I am always happy to talk about research and practice on technology, care, and global “development”, and to support young researchers and social entrepreneurs!
