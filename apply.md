I am building an interdisciplinary lab across Emory and Georgia Tech, and I am actively recruiting students and postdocs interested in HCI (human-computer interaction), computing or informatics, public health, and nursing. Please see the guidelines below if you are interested, and take a look at my past publications to determine if there’s a good fit. My email is azra.ismail AT emory.edu. Given the volume of emails, it is difficult for me to respond to every student. I will be prioritizing emails from students at Emory and Georgia Tech, and those that are responsive to the interests listed below. <br>

I am passionate about supporting students coming from backgrounds that have been systemically excluded from academia (across race, gender, caste, class, ability, and more). Reach out if the mission of the lab strongly resonates with you!

## What I am looking for from prospective students and postdocs
- Interest in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and/or experience with applied ML or NLP <br>
- Prior experience, training, or interest in care settings (broadly defined, may be within or outside the US) <br>
- Passion for social justice and community-driven work <br>
- Interest in interdisciplinary research <br>
- Commitment to learning and growing, and being part of an empathetic and mission-driven group! <br>

I am particularly interested in research with communities in the Atlanta (GA) and South Asian regions, and around reproductive health and wellbeing (but open to other geographies and domains as long there is mission alignment).

## How to apply for research opportunities at the CARE Lab?
